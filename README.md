# 3D Printed Prosthetic Finger

## Project Overview

This project involves designing and 3D printing a low-cost prosthetic finger using SOLIDWORKS and FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology. The aim is to create a functional prosthetic finger that is light, durable, and cost-effective. The design integrates off-the-shelf parts with 3D-printed components to restore finger motion and function.

## Features

- **Customizable Design**: Designed using SOLIDWORKS for precise dimensions and optimal functionality.
- **FDM Printing**: Utilizes PLA (Polylactic Acid) for robust and cost-effective manufacturing.
- **Cost-Effective Solution**: Aimed at providing an affordable alternative to traditional prosthetic fingers.
- **Easy Assembly**: Components are designed for straightforward assembly after printing.

## Components

The prosthetic finger consists of five main components, which are designed in SOLIDWORKS and saved in STL format for 3D printing.

## Design and Printing Process

1. **CAD Model Creation**: 
   - Designed using SOLIDWORKS with accurate dimensions.
   - Refer to YouTube tutorials for guidance on using SOLIDWORKS if needed.

2. **File Preparation**:
   - Saved the design files in STL format.

3. **Slicing**:
   - Used FlashPrint 5 for slicing the STL files.
   - Combined the STL files into a single file in FlashPrint 5 for printing.

4. **3D Printing**:
   - Imported the sliced file into the Flashforge 3D Printer.
   - Adjusted printer settings according to the design and FDM process requirements.

5. **Assembly**:
   - Assembled the components after printing is complete.

## Materials Used

- **PLA (Polylactic Acid)**: Chosen for its ease of use and durability in FDM 3D printing.

## Time Taken

- **Total Time**: Approximately 2 hours for assembly and printing.
